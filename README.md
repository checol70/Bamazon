Hello, if you are a customer run the bamazonCustomer.js in node.  You will be greeted by a table of all the items for sale and asked for an id of the item you want.  After inputing a number that is a valid id it will then prompt you asking for how many you want.  You can only choose positive numbers and cannot choose a number higher than our current stock.  Once you input that it will show you your total for your current spree, then return you to the first page so that you can purchase something else.

If you are a manager then it will show you a list of options.  
    
    view products for sale will show you all available items in the store

    View low inventory will show you which products have dropped below 5 in stock

    add to inventory will allow you to add more to the stock that we have in store.

    add new product will allow you to add a totally new product to the store.

    quit exits the program.
